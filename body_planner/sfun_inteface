Note: Usage of Sfunction is as follows:
Inputs are:
1) lbx_0 - lower bound on x for stage 0, size [7]
2) ubx_0 - upper bound on x for stage 0, size [7]
3) y_ref_0, size [10]
4) y_ref - concatenated for shooting nodes 1 to N-1, size [490]
5) y_ref_e, size [7]
6) lbu for shooting nodes 0 to N-1, size [150]
7) ubu for shooting nodes 0 to N-1, size [150]
 
Outputs are:
1) u0, control input at node 0, size [3]
2) utraj, control input concatenated for nodes 0 to N-1, size [150]
3) xtraj, state concatenated for nodes 0 to N, size [357]
4) acados solver status (0 = SUCCESS)
5) KKT residual
6) x1, state at node 1
7) CPU time
8) SQP iterations
